I spent my childhood soaking up the fog in Italy's historical city of Mantova, make sure to check out local cuisine! My passion for technology led me to pursue a Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. After an exciting stint in Chicago and a second Master's in Computer Science at UIC, I made my way to the San Francisco Bay Area to sharpen my software product craftsmanship.

Although Product Engineering keeps me pretty busy, I love diving into other interests such as Physics, Math, Self-improvement, Bodybuilding, Design, Cooking, and Music.

I'm a big fan of exploring this amazing world we live in. I usually try to travel every 2 or 3 months, my next international trips are, in no particular order, Japan, Argentina, Iceland.

Thanks for stopping by my personal website! My aim is to create a serene space away from the chaos of social media, where I can brainstorm and sketch out ideas. So, feel free to take a look around and get to know me better. Cheers!
