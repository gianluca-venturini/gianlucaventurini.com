I currently live in California and work at [Material Security](https://material.security/ "Material Security").

Previously I worked at [Dropbox,](https://www.dropbox.com/ "Dropbox") graduated at [UIC](https://www.uic.edu/ "UIC") and [Politecnico di Milano](https://polimi.it/ "Politecnico di Milano").

Things I'm involved in:

* [Lead the Future]() mentor.

I spent my childhood soaking up the fog in Italy's historical city of [Mantova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantua "Mantova"), make sure to check out the [local cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_Mantua)! My passion for technology led me to pursue a Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. After an exciting stint in Chicago and a second Master's in Computer Science at UIC, I made my way to the San Francisco Bay Area to sharpen my software product craftsmanship.

Although Product Engineering keeps me pretty busy, I love diving into other interests such as Physics, Math, Self-improvement, Bodybuilding, Design, Cooking, and Music.

I'm a big fan of exploring this amazing world we live in. I usually try to travel every 2 or 3 months, my next international trips are, in no particular order, Japan, Argentina, Iceland.

Thanks for stopping by my personal website! My aim is to create a serene space away from the chaos of social media, where I can brainstorm and sketch out ideas. So, feel free to take a look around and get to know me better. Cheers!
