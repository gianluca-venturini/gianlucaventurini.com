In this post I’ll talk about Minimum Viable Product (MVP): reasons for building one, how to build it and with who and finally few traps I’ve fallen into too many times and how to avoid them.

Building an MVP is a great tool to de-risk complex projects early on. If done correctly it’s cheap and improves estimating the complexity of the project by order of magnitudes. Conversely, if done incorrectly could lead to wasting a lot of time obsessing on the wrong prototype details rather than collecting valuable signal needed to take decisions. For example, we may collect the wrong signals mistaking an underwhelming market response due to an excessively buggy initial prototype for a lack of interest, while taking a better and simpler UI could have led to more accurate data collection that reflect interest in the idea.

# Why MVP
There are many reasons for building an MVP. The first one that comes to mind is to convince ourselves that a specific technical approach is viable with the goal of increasing or decreasing the level of confidence in the proposal.

The second reason is for convincing others. We may want to convince investors that we can deliver results with a small demo. We may reassure the product manager that a specific implementation is feasible in a reasonable amount of time. Furthermore, we may want to convince the leadership of the company that we can go from idea to market fast and create a new lucrative business line.

We may want to test different things: using a specific technical approach like adopting a third party library or a team dynamic like embedding machine learning researchers, designers and full stack engineers in the same team.

Next, let’s take who should we build the MVP with.

- Convince yourself
- Convince others. Investor: person with money, product manager, CEO, company that is hiring you with a take home.
- Moonshot VS need to show a lot of execution capabilities
- Hackathon (fun) VS Company (to evaluate an investment)

# Who to build it with
I mostly build MVPs alone. They are the fastest to build because I have a clear goal in mind and I don’t need to coordinate with anyone else. I mostly use MVPs to make up my mind and sometimes as a tool to present a complex idea to colleagues and leadership: MVPs are incredible tools to persuade people that my idea is a good investment.

We may want to build MVPs with friends, for fun during hackathons or with colleagues during Hackweek. Building MVPs can help strengthen bonds between people. I find extremely satisfying when I can prove that an idea either works or doesn’t with high confidence, I can get it out of my head forever.

 I empirically found out that a team between 2 and 4 highly technical people works the best. All discussions are focused on problems, everyone understands what everyone else is working on.

Next, let’s take a look how to build a successful MVP.

- Alone
	- (fun) test the limit of what you can implement, test new technologies
	- (professional) convince yourself that can be done
	- (professional) test an hypothesis on the market
- Hackathon (fun): with friends, for fun.
- Company: with core the team that will implement it. To check team dynamics as well as convince ourselves and others that can be built and scaled.

# How to build it
Depending on why you’re building the MVP and with which people you may adopt different strategies. If you’re building for yourself it’s only important to implement enough to convince yourself that the approach is solid, so it’s necessary to uncover all the unknown unknowns, and derisk most of the known unknowns.

If you’re building for validating a marked hypothesis it’s necessary to polish enough the prototype that you will collect valuable market signals on the idea, rather than feedback about your bad UI. You should keep the amount of feature to the minimum necessary to prove or disprove a hypothesis that you agree upon before starting building.

If you’re building a take-home project for being hired by a company, implement one or two complex features to show off your skills and leave a lot of opportunities to discuss how some of the non-implemented features could improve on top of the MVP.

If you’ve building a Moonshot MVP you may want to iterate really fast and sometimes implement different solutions to the same problem multiple times. High level tests help a lot here, for example integration tests will make sure you’re not introducing regressions without being prescriptive on the interfaces between components, that you are free to change and iterate on very fast.

If you’ve building an Execution Heavy MVP, you may want to focus on team velocity. You want to figure out who are the best people to leverage for the well defined tasks and how to effectively communicate with each other. Since it’s clear what to build, can be convenient to specify interfaces between components defined in advance and leverage unit tests to catch regressions.

Next let’s take a look at traps I’ve feel into in the past and how to avoid them.

- Yourself: jankyest of all, focus on the hardest part you don’t know you can build, no UI
- Company to hire you (take home): make it flashy, implement something hard to impress, leave a lot of space to expand in the discussion. No need to scale
- Moonshot project: implement enough to show the core functionality, enough UI to be usable
- Execution-heavy: implement with the team to show case the velocity of the team.

# Traps to avoid
Scope creep is the enemy #1 of MPVs. Adding unplanned features will delay the launch and dilutes the signal. If an MVP fails because of a missing features, then it was doomed from the beginning. My recommendation is to be ruthless on the number of features to leave out of MVP and implement as “fast follows”. My guess is that engineers know what’s the real MVP but they later self-convince themselves that it’s necessary to have feature X, Y, Z. You should fight it, if you don’t leave out 10% of the features you really want to implement, you’re not leaving out enough.

It happened to me while developing an AI assistant at SPC hackathon in 2024. I added the unnecessary feature of crossing questions from the public that the presented answered. It’s a lot of complexity and didn’t add much to the demo, in fact it even failed on stage hurting the presentation.

Beware of MVPs that show value but are too constrained. For example a demo that only works well on certain data and will be really hard to extend to a real case. I often find this problem with MVPs of systems that use Machine Learning, where the demo works flawlessly due to cherry-picking the right inputs, but then the system fails miserably while used generally.

Another trap is not accepting that the MVP can fail. Not all the tools need to exist. Sometimes the idea is good, but it’s too early or too late or there are better solutions out there or the implementation has major issues. Kill MVPs that for whatever reason fail to find traction after a time boxed amount of time. MVPs are cheap only if you cut the losses them reasonably early.

Building too slow is definitely an MVP killer. I believe you should find some sort of unfair advantage when building an MVP. Maybe a new technology made a previously hard to attach problem 10x faster and the problem is now a low hanging fruit. Sometimes it’s new libraries, sometimes are new developer tools that make you much faster. Sometimes you can create your advantage adding the right people with a lot of energy and positive attitude to the team and spending a lot of hours together. Whatever is the “unfair advantage”, if you don’t find it, and it seems that ”this MVP is taking forever”, you better take the loss and start pushing.

- Keep adding features. Scope creep
- Building without value proposition: we don’t know what we’re building
- Scalability. Demo looks great, but then never scales to real-word scenario. Avoid magical thinking, make the demo as open as possible e.g. user can bring their own data rather than providing a specially crafted set of data and handholding the user through the demo.
- Not considering that the MVP can fail
- Building too slow: too many people involved, not much progress made, not knowing what other people are working on, duplicated features implementation. Keep the team very small, check progress often, once every few hours, work in the same place physically.
- Building for too long: too much scope creep, not clear when to abandon the project. Timebox it, have an exit criteria.
