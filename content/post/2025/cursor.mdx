# AI-assisted development of complex systems
- Fast writing code for easy ideas, 1000 words keyboard
- Rubber Ducking

## Great for learning
- Proposes new APIs and mainstream ways of solving the problem
- Teaches good enough language specific rust patterns, learning language specific patterns

## Bad at strongly opinionated tasks
-  Hard to work on opinionated legacy architectures (e.g. old things or custom that evolved with time)
- Bad at strongly opinionated tasks
	- architecture design
	- picking third party libraries given requirements
	- strongly disagreeing with me
	- Mostly mainstream code, no strong opinions nor adapting to strongly opinionated codebases, regression to the mean

## Bad for intellectual stimulation
- I started coding for intellectual stimulation and fast feedback loop. I want to understand exactly everything I'm writing without having AI in the loop, that would slow me down. No blackbox.

# Github CoPilot
Fully integrated with VSCode. Clunky to use. Very slow code generation.

# Cursor Editor

## What I like
- Looking up APIs public and private (RAG)
- Looking up documentation online
- Deep integration with editor: access to language server error object, file, other files with RAG and

## What I don't like
- VSCode fork. Need to periodically rebase
- Little UI bugs
- Agent not really usable autonomously: ts-prune, remove export

# Opportunities: what I think will improve soon
- Condescending, need more push back <video for sister Anthropic CEO>, reasoning models O1, O3 push back more
- Code generation speed
- Ecosystem: Rust error correction better than typescript because of compiler. Compiler and language server could return much reacher context 
- Editor could become a commodity once the developer community converges on a set of features, nothing in Cursor seems crazy difficult to build, they just got there fast
