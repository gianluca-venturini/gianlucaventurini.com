Every week I discover new tools and ways to integrate them into tech stacks with the goal of simplifying different aspects of my life. In this post I describe what tools I currently use in my life.

## Travel
TODO

## Food
I consume three daily homemade meals, each with fresh ingredients, including a protein (chicken or fish), vegetables, bread, and olive oil, while avoiding grocery shopping except at farmer's markets.

I love cooking, dedicating hours to making pasta or pizza with friends on weekends, but I aim for quick, 10-minute meal prep on weekdays. I use two main techniques for that.

Firstly I use Amazon Fresh for grocery delivery for its time-saving benefits over traditional shopping, despite slightly higher cost. For proteins, I prefer sous vide cooking with reusable bags for an effortless, perfect cook, though I advise against my first-gen Breville due to the maker not maintaining the app. Combined with quick vegetable prep, these methods simplify my weekday meals.

# Finance
Personal finance is not that complicated, it's composed by: budgeting, spending, saving and investing.

For the budgeting part I use Lunchmoney. It's ingesting transaction data from the different credit cards using Plaid, and allows me to review all the transactions in a single place, look at trends and make informed decisions.

For the spending part I utilize various credit cards for specific needs: Bilt for rent, Sapphire Reserve for foreign currency transactions, X1 for secure online shopping, and Chase Amazon Prime for Amazon perks. My selection criteria focus on cards that offer savings effortlessly and don't encourage unnecessary spending.

For the saving and investing part I mainly auto-invest in ETFs transferring a fixed amount of money per month.

# Home
I like to live in a tidy and organized cozy apartment. I have automated most tasks for ease. My Roomba cleans when I'm out, LED strips light up as I move (dimly at night), and plugs shut off at night to save energy.

After facing issues with commercial domotics like Philips Hue's poor iPhone integration and lack of customization, I switched to Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi for its superior customization capabilities, including writing configurations and Python integrations. My system now uses both WiFi and Zigbee (SkyConnect usb dongle connected to the Raspberry) with devices from Philips Hue, TP-Link Kasa, and Aqara, among others. It automates my lighting and blinds, dimming lights an hour before bedtime and raising blinds at my alarm, enhancing my daily routine.

I use Alexa with my Harman Kardon speakers for music, playing low volume lofi coffee shop tunes while working and switching to EDM, rock, and dance at other times.

# Productivity
All my activities are stored in two Google Calendars: one for my personal life and one for work. I use Notion Calendar on desktop and iOS. Reclaim.ai connects to my calendars and automatically moves meetings around to preserve uninterrupted maker time, schedule my recurring 1:1s and allow people to book time with me using a link.

I use Raycast as my window manager on the laptop, enabling me to assign hotkeys for my most-used apps. This setup allows me to switch between applications without needing to use the mouse. Additionally, I utilize Choosy for managing my links efficiently. It ensures that all links open in the appropriate application or the correct Chrome profile. For instance, links from Slack open directly in the Slack app, bypassing the browser and eliminating unnecessary redirects.

I use a 40% Plank keyboard, I wrote a custom firmware so every key does exactly what I want and works consistently on all devices (e.g. the exact same key works consistently on laptop and iPad).

I've written a custom QMK firmware for my 40% Plank keyboard for exact key responses, ensuring uniform typing on devices like my laptop and iPad. This enhances productivity, smooths device transitions and in the future allows me to port the same key layout to another compatible keyboard.

I do most personal writing on Obsidian with co-pilot plugin. I take personal and shared notes on Notion even though I should probably switch those to Obsidian too. Fabric is a great CLI tool to streamline analyzing and producing content.

# Fitness and Health
I prioritize fitness, health and sleep above everything. This is what I do while I'm not traveling. I sleep between 8 to 9 hours every day, the iOS clock app is literally sending me to bed progressively dimming down lights around me using Home Assistant. I track my sleep and workouts with Oura ring and Apple Watch.

I workout 3 to 4 times a week. I don't have a fixed schedule, I tried and whatever I do I'll get bored. I do a combination of interval running with the Nike Run Club app, I do weightlifting tracking the progress with Strong app and I regularly go to classes because I find energizing working out with other people. Additionally I try to mostly bike around the city, I'm lucky that in San Francisco almost never rains.

Recently I used a Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitor for a month to check if some food I'm eating produces unexpected glucose spikes. I validated that a couple of table spoons cider vinegard can significantly reduce glucose spikes (because it slows down digestion).
