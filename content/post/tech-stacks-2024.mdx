Every week, I explore new tools aimed at simplifying tasks in areas like productivity, health, and personal finance. In this post, I'll share some standout tools and explain how they form an essential part of my personal tech stack, making my life easier.

## Travel
In recent years, I prioritized traveling, driven by my natural curiosity and the desire to connect with friends and family scattered across different continents.

When traveling is important to pack light, ideally just bring one carry on and a backpack, if you're spending more than a week away you can always ask the hotel to wash your clothes. I travel with an AwayTravel flexible carry on and a borealis backpack. Additionally I have a smaller borealis backpack to use day-to-day while exploring.

The Kayak app simplifies travel by organizing plane ticket receipts sent via email into one easy-to-view interface. Additionally, its iOS widget offers valuable guidance on airport navigation and updates on flight departures, very useful during the trip.

## Food
I consume three daily homemade meals, each with fresh ingredients, including a protein (chicken or fish), vegetables, bread, and olive oil, while avoiding grocery shopping except at farmer's markets.

I love cooking, dedicating hours to making pasta or pizza with friends on weekends, but I aim for quick, 10-minute meal prep on weekdays. I use two tricks to prepare fast meals with fresh raw ingredients.

Firstly I use Amazon Fresh for grocery delivery for its time-saving benefits over traditional shopping, despite slightly higher cost. For proteins, I prefer sous vide cooking with reusable bags for an effortless, perfect cook, though I advise against my first-gen Breville due to the maker not maintaining the app. Combined with quick boiled or steamed vegetable prep, these methods simplify my weekday meals.

# Home
I like to live in a tidy and organized cozy apartment. I have automated most tasks for ease. My Roomba cleans when I'm out, LED strips light up as I move (dimly at night), and plugs shut off at night to save energy.

After facing issues with commercial domotics like Philips Hue's poor iPhone integration and lack of customization, I switched to Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi for its superior customization capabilities, including writing configurations and Python integrations. My system now uses both WiFi and Zigbee (SkyConnect usb dongle connected to the Raspberry) with devices from Philips Hue, TP-Link Kasa, and Aqara, among others. It automates my lighting and blinds, dimming lights an hour before bedtime and raising blinds at my alarm, enhancing my daily routine.

I use Alexa with my Harman Kardon speakers for music, playing low volume lofi coffee shop tunes while working and switching to EDM, rock, and dance at other times.

# Productivity
All my activities are stored in two Google Calendars: one for my personal life and one for work. I use Notion Calendar on desktop and iOS. Reclaim.ai connects to my calendars and automatically moves meetings around to preserve uninterrupted maker time, schedule my recurring 1:1s and allow people to book time with me using a link.

I use Raycast as my window manager on the laptop, enabling me to assign hotkeys for my most-used apps. This setup allows me to switch between applications without needing to use the mouse. Additionally, I utilize Choosy for managing my links efficiently. It ensures that all links open in the appropriate application or the correct Chrome profile. For instance, links from Slack open directly in the Slack app, bypassing the browser and eliminating unnecessary redirects.

I use a 40% Plank keyboard, I wrote a custom firmware so every key does exactly what I want and works consistently on all devices (e.g. the exact same key works consistently on laptop and iPad).

I've written a custom QMK firmware for my 40% Plank keyboard for exact key responses, ensuring uniform typing on devices like my laptop and iPad. This enhances productivity, smooths device transitions and in the future allows me to port the same key layout to another compatible keyboard.

I do most personal writing on Obsidian with co-pilot plugin. I take personal and shared notes on Notion even though I should probably switch those to Obsidian too. Fabric is a great CLI tool to streamline analyzing and producing content.

# Finance
Personal finance is not that complicated, it's composed by: budgeting, spending, saving and investing.

For the budgeting part I use Lunchmoney. It's ingesting transaction data from the different credit cards using Plaid, and allows me to review all the transactions in a single place, look at trends and make informed decisions.

For the spending part I utilize various credit cards for specific needs: Bilt for rent, Sapphire Reserve for foreign currency transactions, X1 for secure online shopping, and Chase Amazon Prime for Amazon perks. My selection criteria focus on cards that offer savings effortlessly and don't encourage unnecessary spending.

I automate my savings and investments by allocating a fixed monthly sum into ETFs, chosen for their diversified exposure and potential for growth.

# Fitness and Health
I prioritize fitness, health and sleep above everything. This is what I do while I'm not traveling. I sleep 8 to 9 hours every day, the iOS clock app is sending me to bed progressively dimming down lights around me using Home Assistant. I track my sleep and workouts with Oura ring and Apple Watch.

I exercise 3 or 4 times a week, opting for a flexible routine to keep things interesting. My workouts include interval running using the Nike Run Club app, weightlifting with progress tracked by the Strong app, and attending group classes for the communal energy boost. I also frequently bike around San Francisco, taking advantage of the city's dry weather.

Recently I used a Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitor for a month to check if some food I'm eating produces unexpected glucose spikes. Most notable discovery is that a couple of table spoons cider vinegar can significantly reduce glucose spikes (because it slows down digestion).
