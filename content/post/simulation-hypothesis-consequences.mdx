# What is simulation hypothesis
The Simulation Hypothesis (SH) states that conscious beings could emerge inside a simulation of the universe. For the being inside the simulation the simulated reality is indistinguishable from the reality. Nick Bostrom, a strong supporter of the theory, suggests as argument that either humans won’t ever be able to simulate an universe with conscious beings, or if we will be capable, we already live in a simulation. The current exponential progress in computational power suggests the latter.

If we assume that consciousness can arise from a complex system, any actor capable of creating a simulation that allows such a degree of complexity may create conscious beings.

Something that always bothered me about the SH is the implicit hierarchy between universes. It relies on the existence of a original universe, a sort of “bare metal” that runs on top of “real physics” (analogy between bare metal VS virtual machine computation paradigms). SI doesn’t intellectually satisfies me, it feels incomplete, somewhat doesn’t pass the Occam’s Razor test, just adds extra simulation steps between the original universe creation and my experience of the world without attempting to explain the emergence of the original universe. An attempt to solve is the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH) that states that physics is not merely described by mathematics. According to MUH the existence of a mathematical description, implies the emergence of the physics.

- Consciousness arises from complexity, dynamic system, Occam Razor
- Universe spawns other universes, if it can produce enough complexity
- Bare metal universe

# Parallel with video games

MUH always seemed a little too abstract and seemingly non-falsifiable. In contrast SI seems much more testable because it assumes finite computation resources dedicated to our universe simulation. For example we could concentrate high level of information (energy or matter) in a small amount of space and see how the underline simulation behaves. We already observe weak evidences of the simulation running on finite resources, e.g. spacetime behaves weirdly in presence of high level of information, forming black holes, or at a very small scale not allowing us to measure precisely where a particle is located, forcing us to use probabilistic theories.

- Videogame and simulations we already make
- Assume videogame simulation for communicating to you. Probably concept of time and spacial dimensions can be wildly different between the simulated and above universe
- Interactions between simulated world and external one, moving around the world flips bits, can draw more power, can heat up the laptop, it definitely interacts
- Minimum amount of time and space to be simulated to make sense: plank distance and uncertainty principle. Videogame analogy breaks, but in principle we have minimum distances to discretely simulate.

# What’s enough to feel consciousness?
- What’s needed for consciousness to arise? Necessary to move electrons and other physical pieces around?
- How much do you need to store? Do you need to store only the current state or can you store the entire universe from beginning at a minimum resolution?
- Block universe: TODO video
- Is the connection with bare metal universe necessary?

# In favor of MUH
- Thought experiment: assume you can store block universe at a specific minimum but finite resolution. Above a threshold experience consciousness. Do you need to store all of it? Can it really be destroyed from the POV of the agents inside the universe or since it has been described once for them it exists forever? Does it even need to be described or the fact that a block universe could exists, than it make it exists from the POV of the agents. Do all possible universes exists and all possibly conscious agents experience the one where they are conscious?
