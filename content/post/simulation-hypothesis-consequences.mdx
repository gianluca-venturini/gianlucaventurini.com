# Consciousness
- intro
Everyone experiences consciousness. It's similar to an emotion and provides us with a sense of individual identity, rather than making us perceive ourselves as merely a collection of cells. Consciousness might be the feeling we experience while our brain is functioning.

- definition of consciousness
Consciousness is vaguely defined as a set of intellettive skills like awareness of surroundings, self-awareness and displaying emotions. Not every being needs consciousness to survive and reproduce. Simple beings behavior mostly depends on the current inputs and not much on the internal state. For example, ants mostly react to their external environment: light, hormones sprayed by other ants, presence of food. The next action is stored in a small lookup table: given the current sensory inputs, they act in a deterministic way. More complex beings, such as predators, need to remember past experiences, learn from them, react based on their emotions and engage in complex problem solving.


# Consciousness as emergent behavior

- consciousness arises from complexity
Consciousness likely arises In the brain from a process that combines learnings from the past, problem solving skills with recent observations and current sensory inputs to produce sophisticated behavior. There surely was evolutionary pressure to learn to simulate the world in our minds. For example, primitive humans could track prey for days without needing to see them constantly. They forecasted the animal's behavior and simulated the mental states of their fellow hunters. They progressed from just choosing an action based on what they see now, to choosing an action based on what they have learned, they have seen in the previous days and based on what they think the fellows hunters are thinking now.

- emergent behavior understanding
Can we think about consciousness and specifically self-awareness as a behavior that emerges in a sufficiently complex dynamic system?

There are two steps I’ve learned to approach learning about an emergent behavior: firstly we need to understand what’s the medium of the interaction, secondly we need to understand how the complex behavior emerges from simple interactions inside the medium. In our case I believe we started understanding the medium: it’s circuits made of biological neurons firing together when a specific input is presented. Maybe we need more esoteric physics to better explain how neurons are firing and build more accurate models, but for our thought experiment we can use rudimentary models. The second step is much more interesting in my opinion. Potentially consciousness arises from a high number of neural circuits wired together with a very specific architecture. I don’t know if my intuition is true, so for now let’s call it a conjecture and see the analogies with artificial neural networks.

- analogy with mechanistic interpretability
In the last few months I’ve been fascinated by the field of mechanistic interpretability of artificial neural networks. It’s interesting how a large number of facts are stored inside a relatively small number of weights. Weight in this context is a threshold that tells us if a ”neuron” downstream is firing when a connected upstream neuron fires. Given enough parameters (enough complexity) the networks exhibits an emergent reasoning behavior. The network becomes for example capable of executing simple arithmetics or make simple deductions from facts it memorized rather than simply regurgitating text in the training set. In other words it has a simplified internal representation of the world and it can retrieve it given a certain input.

- perceive as one when being two
Another interesting fact somewhat related to the conjecture is that a human perceives themselve as one despite having brains with two emispheres connected together. Two distinct systems can operate so in synchrony that the feeling of a single “self” can arise. A small number of humans have the emispheres connection disrupted with a surgical procedure or traumatic event. They effectively have two distinct brains that need to coordinate without directly sending neural signals to each other. A lot of experiments have been conducted on these split brain people, for example showing images to only one eye and ask the other emisphere in charge of speech to articulate what they are seeing. While perception is definitely split, consciousness doesn’t seem to be. The two separate emispheres somehow learn other ways of communicating and consciousness still emerges.

# Multi-individual consciousness

- how multiple humans can perceive as one?
Now the next question to ask: can a multi-person consciousness emerge if multiple people are interacting together? What’s the minimum bandwidth necessary? In the past three decades Internet facilitated the connection serving as medium, but the bandwidth seems to be relatively small and very comparable to people talking together. This is about to change in the next few years. What happens when neurons firing in one person brain influence neurons in another person brain? The very exciting part here is that BCIs like Neuralink are now a reality. The company has proven that the entire stack works in multiple humans and the technology has a lot of momentum in term of funding and media attention. Now that the science work it becomes an engineering problem. The increase in bandwidth is a very similar problem to miniaturized and exponentially scaling the transistor based Integrated circuits.

I recommend this interesting 8 hours Neuralink immersion.

# What is simulation hypothesis
The Simulation Hypothesis (SH) states that conscious beings could emerge inside a simulation of the universe. For the being inside the simulation the simulated reality is indistinguishable from the reality. Nick Bostrom, a strong supporter of the theory, suggests as argument that either humans won’t ever be able to simulate an universe with conscious beings, or if we will be capable, we already live in a simulation. The current exponential progress in computational power suggests the latter.

If we assume that consciousness can arise from a complex system, any actor capable of creating a simulation that allows such a degree of complexity may create conscious beings.

Something that always bothered me about the SH is the implicit hierarchy between universes. It relies on the existence of a original universe, a sort of “bare metal” that runs on top of “real physics” (analogy between bare metal VS virtual machine computation paradigms). SI doesn’t intellectually satisfies me, it feels incomplete, somewhat doesn’t pass the Occam’s Razor test, just adds extra simulation steps between the original universe creation and my experience of the world without attempting to explain the emergence of the original universe. An attempt to solve is the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH) that states that physics is not merely described by mathematics. According to MUH the existence of a mathematical description, implies the emergence of the physics.

- Consciousness arises from complexity, dynamic system, Occam Razor
- Universe spawns other universes, if it can produce enough complexity
- Bare metal universe

# Parallel with video games

MUH always seemed a little too abstract and seemingly non-falsifiable. In contrast SI seems much more testable because it assumes finite computation resources dedicated to our universe simulation. For example we could concentrate high level of information (energy or matter) in a small amount of space and see how the underline simulation behaves. We already observe weak evidences of the simulation running on finite resources, e.g. spacetime behaves weirdly in presence of high level of information, forming black holes, or at a very small scale not allowing us to measure precisely where a particle is located, forcing us to use probabilistic theories.

- Videogame and simulations we already make
- Assume videogame simulation for communicating to you. Probably concept of time and spacial dimensions can be wildly different between the simulated and above universe
- Interactions between simulated world and external one, moving around the world flips bits, can draw more power, can heat up the laptop, it definitely interacts
- Minimum amount of time and space to be simulated to make sense: plank distance and uncertainty principle. Videogame analogy breaks, but in principle we have minimum distances to discretely simulate.

# What’s enough to feel consciousness?
- What’s needed for consciousness to arise? Necessary to move electrons and other physical pieces around?
- How much do you need to store? Do you need to store only the current state or can you store the entire universe from beginning at a minimum resolution?
- Block universe: TODO video
- Is the connection with bare metal universe necessary?

# In favor of MUH
- Thought experiment: assume you can store block universe at a specific minimum but finite resolution. Above a threshold experience consciousness. Do you need to store all of it? Can it really be destroyed from the POV of the agents inside the universe or since it has been described once for them it exists forever? Does it even need to be described or the fact that a block universe could exists, than it make it exists from the POV of the agents. Do all possible universes exists and all possibly conscious agents experience the one where they are conscious?
