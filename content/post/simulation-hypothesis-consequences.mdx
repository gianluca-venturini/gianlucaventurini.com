# Consciousness
- Consciousness arises from complexity and evolution pressure to maintain an internal state of the world
- sequential VS combinatorics logic
- Consciousness is a spectrum, being self-aware is just one of the steps. TODO Kurknagtz video
- Connecting two brain emispheres Creates a single contiousness, how many neuralink connections do you need for connecting two brain to experience a single consciousness?
- Poking at the brain: Neuralink interview

# What is simulation hypothesis
- Consciousness arises from complexity, dynamic system, Occam Razor
- Universe spawns other universes, if it can produce enough complexity
- Bare metal universe

# Parallel with video games
- Videogame and simulations we already make
- Assume videogame simulation for communicating to you. Probably concept of time and spacial dimensions can be wildly different between the simulated and above universe
- Interactions between simulated world and external one, moving around the world flips bits, can draw more power, can heat up the laptop, it definitely interacts
- Minimum amount of time and space to be simulated to make sense: plank distance and uncertainty principle. Videogame analogy breaks, but in principle we have minimum distances to discretely simulate.
- TODO: geohotz video

# What’s enough to feel consciousness?
- What’s needed for consciousness to arise? Necessary to move electrons and other physical pieces around?
- How much do you need to store? Do you need to store only the current state or can you store the entire universe from beginning at a minimum resolution?
- Block universe: TODO video
- Is the connection with bare metal universe necessary?
- Thought experiment: assume you can store block universe at a specific minimum but finite resolution. Above a threshold experience consciousness. Do you need to store all of it? Can it really be destroyed from the POV of the agents inside the universe or since it has been described once for them it exists forever? Does it even need to be described or the fact that a block universe could exists, than it make it exists from the POV of the agents. Do all possible universes exists and all possibly conscious agents experience the one where they are conscious?
