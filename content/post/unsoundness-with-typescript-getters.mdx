While reading [The Seven Sources of Unsoundness in TypeScript](https://effectivetypescript.com/2021/05/06/unsoundness/) I was thinking other methods to trick TypeScript in inferring the incorrect type. Turns out you can use getters to trick typeguards into thinking a variable has a certain type at compile time, while at runtime it has another.

We can exploit the TypeScript behavior that expects a getter to return the last value that was set on an object in the same synchronous scope and the fact that a getter is a function that can return anything it wants at runtime.

The following code will compile without problems, but at runtime it will call callAliveCat() with a DeadCat half of the times.

```typescript
class Box {
    get observe(): AliveCat | DeadCat {
        if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
            return { name: 'Silvestro', meow: true };
        } else {
            return { name: 'Grumpy Cat', doNothing: true }
        }
    }
}

function callAliveCat(cat: AliveCat) {
    console.log(cat.meow);
}

function f() {
    const box = new Box();
    if (isAlive(box.observe)) {
        // Half the times the cat is dead, 
        // but TypeScript thinks it's always alive
        callAliveCat(box.observe);
    }
}
```

For the entire if block the compiler thinks box.observe is AliveCat, just because it was when isAlive() was invoked.

If we make observe() a function instead everything works correctly.

```typescript
function f() {
    const box = new Box();
    if (isAlive(box.observe())) {
        // Now this is a compile error
        callCat(box.observe());
    }
}
```

In my opinion TypeScript should be fixed to keep into account this edge case rather than assuming the developer never implements dynamic getters.
