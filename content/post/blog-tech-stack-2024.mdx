Outline:
- Why blogging
- Control full stack, domain
- Simple stack, needs to be stateless, all content in git repo
- Deploy pushing to `master` branch with Vercel
- Needs to be fast and free
- Separation content from presentation
- CMS choice
- Writing and synching tools

# Why blogging
- Slow intentional activity
- Searching for people similar to me
- Technical challenge of creating a modern blog from scratch
# A good blog should be a good website
- Performance, simple stack, little busy work
# Future proofing
- Control full stack, domain
- Minimize party framework
- Stateless, good abstractions, without dependencies on third party services, all content in git repo
# Optimize for writing
- No complex workflows, open Obsidian and write
- Automatic deployment when pushing to `master`
# Tech stack
- Abstractions
- Store content in mdx files, markdown, but supports custom React components for more complex inline demos
- Nextjs
- TinaCMS as headless CMS (edits directly on their web UI) and CDN for images
- Tools be around for a while, weâ€™re at mid life
# Deploy pipeline
- Push to git repo, Vercel auto deploy
- TinaCMS serves images
- Feed RSS, email every day
# Tools for writing
- Obsidian, editor, on iOS and OSX
- iOS Working Copy
- Obsidian copilot (wrote mobile support)
# Conclusion
- Writing for more thinking clearly
- Writing a new blog post should be fast and easy and support the best tools
- Make complex things possible
