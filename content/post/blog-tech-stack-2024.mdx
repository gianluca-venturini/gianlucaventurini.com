Outline:
- Why blogging
- Control full stack, domain
- Simple stack, needs to be stateless, all content in git repo
- Deploy pushing to `master` branch with Vercel
- Needs to be fast and free
- Separation content from presentation
- CMS choice
- Writing and synching tools

# Why blogging
I started blogging few years ago with the goal of becoming a better communicator. Writing about ideas and rewriting multiple times helps me clarifying my thinking and often highlight that I don’t know as much as I thought about a topic.

At a time dominated by social media attention-grabbing fast content, curating a blog is a slow and intentional activity. It allows me to think about a concept for hours at a time, write about it from multiple angles, and then rewrite until it’s simple enough that can be digested in few minutes. I hope to attract a crowd of like-minded peers and have engaging discussions with on a wide range of topics I care about.

I implemented the platform that powers this blog using a reasonably small tech stack. I decided to not rely on any existing blogging platform because I enjoy the process of implementing a feature with the smallest amount of code possible. It’s all available in this GitHub repo, so you can go there and read every single commit.

# Future proofing
I want this blog to remain online for the years to come, with minimal maintenance. For this reason I decided to build a static website.

I don’t want to rely on any third party platform that can go out of business or start monetizing my content. I want to own as much as possible of the stack and only take dependencies on commoditized services that I can easily replace when needed. I currently host the website on Vercel, served on my own domain. It re-deploys automatically when I merge a commit to `master` through a GitHub integration. The domain auto-renews and everything else is completely hands off. I don’t need to worry about the blogging service shutting down years from now, I can easily move to a separate hosting provider or replace React and Nextjs with another JSX-based static website generator framework.

I decided to store both blog code and content in the same Git repository. For the content format I decided to use markdown, it’s very standardized and supported by a large number of commodity libraries I can swap if the one I’m using becomes deprecated. I’m using a markdown extension called `mdx` that allows me to embed custom JSX components together with formatted text, that will make complex things possible.

- Control full stack, domain
- Minimize third party framework
- Stateless, good abstractions, without dependencies on third party services, all content in git repo

# A good blog should be a good website
The blog should load fast in your browser. I’m serving all the static assets from a couple CDNs: Vercel Edge Network for javascript bundle and styles and Tina CMS for images. Both services are very easy to replace in the future.

I’m collecting user experience metrics and keep an eye on how much time is needed to render it on the users browser.

- Performance, simple stack, little busy work

# Optimize for writing
I optimized for writing the blog on a text editor. The goal is to never touch the code unless I need to implement a new feature.

When I’ve an idea, I just open Obsidian on iPad and start writing, distraction free. I commit often the progress on a git branch with Working Copy. When I’m done with a post, I simply merge to master and it’s live a couple of minutes later.

I use Obsidian copilot: it’s a great plugin that allows to co-edit text with LLMs directly in the text editor. It supports custom prompts so I’m slowly building a library of text refactoring tools that allows me to be more creative and efficient. I ported the plugin on mobile because I really liked it and wanted to make it available to mobile users like myself.

- No complex workflows, open Obsidian and write
- Automatic deployment when pushing to `master`
- Obsidian, editor, on iOS and OSX
- iOS Working Copy
- Obsidian copilot (wrote mobile support)
# Tech stack
- Abstractions
- Store content in mdx files, markdown, but supports custom React components for more complex inline demos
- Nextjs
- TinaCMS as headless CMS (edits directly on their web UI) and CDN for images
- Tools be around for a while, we’re at mid life
# Deploy pipeline
- Push to git repo, Vercel auto deploy
- TinaCMS serves images
- Feed RSS, email every day
# Conclusion
- Writing for more thinking clearly
- Writing a new blog post should be fast and easy and support the best tools
- Make complex things possible
